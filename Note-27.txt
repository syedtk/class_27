01. What is Bubble of javascript?
        
Event bubbling directs an event to its target. It works like this:

    ** When an element (like a button) is clicked, an event is directed to the element.
    ** If an event handler is set for the element, the event handler is triggered.
    ** Then the event "bubbles up" to the elements parent.
    ** If an event handler is set for the parent, this event handler is triggered.
    ** The event continues to bubble, until it reaches the top (the document element).to as event bubbling.




02. what is delegation of javascript
        Delegation in JavaScript refers to the concept of handling events by assigning a single event listener to a parent element rather than attaching multiple event listeners to individual child elements. This approach leverages event bubbling, where an event occurring on a nested element will "bubble up" through its ancestors.
